    Thawed puff pastry
    1/3 cup of sliced almonds

    Add the almonds on top.
    Place the 2nd cheese wheel over the almonds, as if you were making a sandwich.
    Wrap the remaining pastry dough around the top of the cheese.
    Place it in the over for 15 to 20 minutes, until the dough gets a light brown color.
    Let it sit for at least 5 minutes and serve with crackers.
