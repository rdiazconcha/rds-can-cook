shortdescription: A great way to turn the most amazing of cheeses into a delicious sweet appetizer.
ingredients: 
    1 small wheel of Brie cheese
    Thawed puff pastry
    1/3 cup of sliced almonds

    Preheat the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 Celsius)
    Slice the cheese in a horizontal half, so that you end up with 2 wheels.
    Place the puff pastry flat on a lightly greased pan.
    Place one of the cheese wheels on the pastry, with the cheese side facing up. 
    Add the almonds on top.
    Place the 2nd cheese wheel over the almonds, as if you were making a sandwich.
    Wrap the remaining pastry dough around the top of the cheese.
    Place it in the over for 15 to 20 minutes, until the dough gets a light brown color.
    Let it sit for at least 5 minutes and serve with crackers.
