title: Roasted Duck Legs and Potatoes
category: main courses
shortdescription: Roasted duck legs with potatoes
ingredients:

Duck
- 2 duck legs
- 2 baking potatoes or 1 lb of other large white potatoes
- Few sprigs of fresh thyme
- Salt and pepper

Sauce
- 3/4 cup orange juice, plus 2 Tbsps
- 3/4 cup chicken broth
- 1 cup orange marmalade
- 1 Tbsp cornstarch
directions:

Duck
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. 
 
On the stove, heat a small roasting pan (cast iron pan works well) and sear the duck legs, skin-side down over medium heat until the skin turns golden and gives out some oil. 
 
Turn the legs over, and take the pan off the heat while you cut the potatoes into 1-inch slices across, then cut each slice into 4. Arrange these potato pieces around the duck legs, then let a few sprigs of thyme fall over the duck and potatoes, and season with salt and pepper, before putting into the preheated oven. 

Cook for two hours, occasionally turning the potatoes, for optimal outcome, which is tender duck legs and crispy potatoes, though both will be ready to eat after 1 1/2 hours. 

Sauce
In a small saucepan, combine orange juice, chicken broth, and orange marmalade. Bring to a boil over high heat, and then lower heat and simmer for 15 minutes. If the mixture is too thick, then mix cornstarch with 2 tablespoons orange juice in a small bowl to make a slurry. Add slurry to sauce and briefly return to a boil. Keep warm until ready to serve.
